WSH Toolbox is an iOS app I wrote as a request from my Dad for his company.
For the time being, the feature set is limited;
WSH Toolbox assists Occupational Safety inspectors in calculating exposure limits for various types of chemical spills and provides a means to generate email reports.
It gave me an excuse to get my hands dirty with XCode, and get a little more familiar with Apple's developer tools.
It's built using the excellent [QuickDialog](https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog) library, so building the forms was pretty simple.
It's currently being distributed to testers via [TestFlight](https://testflightapp.com/) as a closed beta.
